Three build-in life cycles:
1. Default - deployment
2. Clean - cleaning
3. Site - project's site documentation

Default life cycle has the following phases:
1. validate
2. compile
3. test
4. package
5. verify (executs these phases implicitelly: validate, compile, package and then verify)
6. install
7. deploy

Each phases can be granulated by 'plugin goals'.
A plugin goal represents a specific task (finer than a build phase).

The phases named with hyphenated-words (pre-*, post-*, or process-*)
are not usually directly called from the command line.

Failsafe and code coverage plugins bind goals to integration-test and
verify phases.

Phases are 'plugin phases' and can be expressed also explicitelly - e.g.:
1. compile    compiler:compile
2. test       surefire:test
3. package    jar:jar

The second way to add goals to phases is to configure plugins in your
project. Plugins are artifacts that provide goals to Maven.
