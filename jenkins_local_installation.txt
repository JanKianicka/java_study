# In course of CTBTO preparation study, steps for installation of Jenkins:

1. Root installations:
  wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  yum repolist
  yum check-update
  yum update
  yum info mailx

  wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
  rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
  yum install jenkins
  vim /etc/sysconfig/jenkins
  systemctl start jenkins.service

  # Interesting files of Jenkins
  /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/My_first_job/config.xml
  /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/

  # Network configuration on VM
  /etc/hosts - purpose of this file is to resolve hostnames that cannot be resolved any other way
  /etc/resolv.conf - This file specifies the IP addresses of DNS servers and the search domain.
  /etc/sysconfig/network - Specifies routing and host information for all network interfaces
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ -  For each network interface, there is a corresponding interface configuration script.
  > 

  # Network command Windows CMD
  telnet 192.168.160.104 22 (IP address)
  
  
  # Accessible from outside
  This was hard - describe latter - I have lost/spent so much time,
  whole this dready day on this.  Finally it was in proxi,
  forwarding. And I still do not know whether it is done correctly.
  We may try then to make the communication via SSH, but I would
  prefer to focus on different study fields.  May be just to take off
  a short while again.  But on monday we shall document this all
  troubles here including the set up steps.

  Outdate of Oracle Virutal Box has caused mallfunction of the VM after reboot.
  I had to:
  - upgrade Oracle Virtual Box
  - upgrade CentOS 7 inside the machine
  - install extensions
  - add memory to the graphical card (otherwise the Gnome GUI got stuck)
  - changed the network adapter to Bridged only
  
  Then:
  - reverted locally created httpd config file
  mv /etc/httpd/conf.d/localhost.localdomain.conf /home/kianicka/ -v
  Started httpd - appache tomcat web server
  systemctl start httpd.service
  In this case the wellcome web page was already available on port 80:
  http://192.168.161.39:80
  even from outside the machine.

  Then I have prepared the following reverse proxy for localhost
  and http port:
  /etc/httpd/conf.d/localhost.localdomain.conf
  ---
  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost.localdomain
    ServerAdmin jan.kianicka@microstep-mis.com
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/ nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost.localdomain/
    ProxyRequests Off
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    SSLEngine Off 
  </VirtualHost>
  ---
  This is forwarding http packets from port 80 to port 8080.
  In this case we have Jenkins main page available on localhost:
  http://localhost
  and from outside
  http://<IP>:80

  Preparation of local nod for maven and java project:
  yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64
  ls -l /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-1.el7_6.x86_64

  Maven installed with devault configuration here:
  /opt/apache-maven-3.5.3
  

  TODO - next steps here shall be:
  turn on SSL and https together with pertaining study
  Attache second node.
  
1.1 Import of the exported OVA file of the machine with my Jenkins.
  Importing of OVA to Hyper V:
  http://blog.worldofjani.com/?p=991
  - installing Oracle VirtualBox
  - conversion:
   D:\VMs>"c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" clonemedium --format vhd Dev_CentOS-disk002.vmdk Dev_CentOS-disk002.vhd
   0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
   Clone medium created in format 'vhd'. UUID: 6d7d4a02-7107-447b-a427-ab139b8bcadb

  http://www.fixedbyvonnie.com/2014/11/virtualbox-showing-32-bit-guest-versions-64-bit-host-os

  https://smudj.wordpress.com/2015/05/14/windows-10-hyper-v-setting-up-networking-shared-and-bridged-options/
  
  Unfortunatelly, the machine worked correctly only in rescue mode.
  After cloning the partition there were missing /dev/centos partitions.
  The reparations would be intensive and tricky - decribed e.g. here:
  https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=52140

  We are switiching to Oracle VirtualBox and had to disable Hyper V.
  They can not both run with full features on the same hosting windows OS.

2. Jenkins it self configurations
  My Github credential were provided.
  Clone was successfull.
  First admin account initialized:
   ---
   # First admin role
   login: JenkinsAdmin
   pass: MyFirstConfig1
   email: jan.kianicka@microstep-mis.com
   ---
  Next step - made jenkins to be accessible from outside world.
  Done.
  
  Internal URL: http://localhost:8080/login?from=%2F
  
  Next step will be crating Java Maven job with sample unit tests
  There is sample project: git@github.com:JanKianicka/java_study.git
  java_study/maven_test/

  Preparation of Jenkins for maven projects.
  1. Installed Maven Integration plugin
  2. In Global Tool Configuration configured Maven
     Default settings provider: /opt/apache-maven-3.5.3/conf/settings.xml
     Default global settings provider: /opt/apache-maven-3.5.3/conf/settings.xml
  3. In Global Tool Configuration configured JDK installation
     Name: JDK1.8
     JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-1.el7_6.x86_64/
  4. Created new Maven project - My_first_jenkins_job
     as GitHub project
     Root POM: maven_test/pom.xml
     Goals and options: clean install
     others were default.
  After this it was possible to use local nod for compilation and
  running unit tests for my first maven project.

  New Hyper V instance - http://192.168.0.24/job/My_first_jenkins_job/

  TODO: 
  and with SSH retrieval of the GitHub repository.
  Storing of my SSH key.

  Then creating of the remote java worker.
  Then creating of the C worker with integrated C project using C-check.
